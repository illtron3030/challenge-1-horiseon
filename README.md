# <Marketing Website Refractor Challenge>

## Description

    The Purpose of this project was to refractor code for a wesbite to make it more concise, to add some elements to the code, and make it more user accessable.  My motivation was to get my hands dirty with HTML and CSS and to learn how to make a well made README.md because all projects will require one.  I built this project to practice HTML, CSS, and a README.md and to understand how a website with just HTML and CSS and look great.  The problems I solved were to refractor code to make it more clean and more user friendly like adding alt tags to images.
